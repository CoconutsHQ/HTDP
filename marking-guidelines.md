Subjective Marking Guidelines
=============================

Clarity: 5 marks
----------------

Clarity of a program is judged as how comprehensible
the entire program is. This will include how well
the naming of each function and variable is chosen.
How well formatted the whole code is and how readable
the entire structure is.

Simplicity: 2 marks
-------------------

A program is simple if it conveys it's intend using
a minimum set of components and they are used in a
manner in which they are not braided together too
tightly.

Cleverness: 1 mark
-----------------

If the program is solved in a way that is clever.
Too much cleverness is rarely good in programming
as most of the time is spent debugging and everyone
reading has to be as clever as the original programmer
when trying to understand the program. But it should
be incentivised because tradtional practices are 
rarely the best.

Feel: 2 marks
------------
For the squishy area of what you felt after reading the
program overall. Sometimes even when a program is simple,
clever and clear, there might be something that irks you.
A 2 mark to help you express your heart's content.
